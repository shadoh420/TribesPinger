# TribesPinger

Ping a location in game and have it visible to your teammates.

## Installation

Unzip the latest release to your Tribes folder. This will turn targetting for beacons off (server script required) so you should set ``` $pref::ignoreTargets = "False"; ``` in ClientPrefs.cs in order to see pings.

Bind ```Ping``` in game to use.
